# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
Yes just change the loop so it stops when i is greater than 7
